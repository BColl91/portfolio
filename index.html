    <h3>Why I joined CodeNation</h3>
    <p>I want to learn more languages in coding and see what job oppurtunities I can get from my learnings. I do have an ideal career I wish to start in but I understand that I need to be realistic.</p>

    <h3>My targets and current progress</h3>
    <p>My ideal career change would be to work in developing games. With some experience in character design, a creative mind and hobby that is gaming, I believe I would enjoy building such a career.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Alternatively, I have been given resources to learn data analysis. Some of the methods I have learned have been intruiging and confidence boosting.</p>
    <p>I understand that I need to work on my communication skills more, I need to be more active on LinkedIn, Reaching out to others and showing what I can do is greatly benifical.</p>
