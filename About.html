    <h1>Rebecca Collins</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p class="light">I am based in Liverpool and aiming to develop my skills to idealy work in Game Development! It would be fun and interesting to be able to create something that I enjoy so often! </p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Skills and Developments</h2>
    <p class="light">I have recently finished learning level 3 <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp">Python</a> (which was eye-opening) and have gained a certificate in Digital Skills Level 2. I'm hoping to get more comfortable with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript">JavaScript </a> and build my confidence in working with others. I will be researching more on what skills and experience may be required to work in the industry. </p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Personal</h2>
    <p class="light">In my free time I am usually found playing various computer or PS5 games. I am currently on Final Fantasy:Rebirth (No Spoilers please!) and Baldurs Gate 3 (You can spoil. My sister already didü´†). My favourite characters from both are Barret, Tifa, Karlach and Shovel. üëÄ</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Some of My Favourite Games include..</h2>
    <ul id="list">
        <li>Final Fantasy 9</li>
        <li>Omori</li>
        <li>Final Fantasy 7 (Both OG and Remake) </li>
        <li>JackBox Party Franchise</li>
        <li>Genshin Impact</li>
        <li>Stray</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p class="light">I also enjoy ocasionally watching films, shows, youtube skits.. (etc) and am currently enjoying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious_in_Dungeon" target="_blank">Delicious in Dungeon!</a> </p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>My targets and current progress</h3>
    <p>My ideal career change would be to work in developing games. With some experience in character design, a creative mind and hobby that is gaming, I believe I would enjoy building such a career.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Alternatively, I have been given resources to learn data analysis. Some of the methods I have learned have been intruiging and confidence boosting.</p>
    <p>I understand that I need to work on my communication skills more, I need to be more active on LinkedIn, Reaching out to others and showing what I can do is greatly benifical.</p>
    <p class="light">Random Fact: I actually have an honours degree in Costume Making for Stage and Screen. </p>
    <p class="light">I also have a 3 year old cat called Benji and he is a little monster‚ô•Ô∏è</p>
